      <p1>Who Was Muhammad Ali?</p1>

      <p>
        Muhammad Ali was a boxer, philanthropist and social activist
        who is universally regarded as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Ali became an Olympic gold medalist in 1960 and the world heavyweight boxing champion in 1964.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Following his suspension for refusing military service,
        Ali reclaimed the heavyweight title two more times during the 1970s,
        winning famed bouts against Joe Frazier and George Foreman along the way.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984,
        Ali devoted much of his time to philanthropy,
        earning the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005.
